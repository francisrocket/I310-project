Data type and description: The "University" and "Country "categories are strings, "THE 2022", "QS 2023", "ARWU 2021", "USNWR 2022", "Average *", and "Ranking based on the average" are all floats.

No known or potential issues such as bias, potentially a small sample size (only top 1000 while many more universities exist)
